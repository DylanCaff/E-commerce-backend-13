## Description 

An e-commerce website requires a backend system that can store and manage data. For this purpose, a MySQL database is being used along with several technologies such as MySQL2, Express, Sequelize, and dotenv. These technologies work together to create an application backend that can handle various aspects of the e-commerce site, such as storing product information, managing orders, and processing payments.
